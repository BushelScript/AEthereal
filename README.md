# AEthereal

## AppleScript-compatible AppleEvents for Swift

AEthereal constructs, sends, and receives replies from AppleScript-compatible AppleEvents. "AppleScript-compatible" means that the entire standard AppleEvent Object Model (object and insertion specifiers, etc.) is available and supported.

## Origin

AEthereal consists primarily of the "dynamic bridge" portion of hhas' SwiftAutomation framework. Tweaks have been made where appropriate.

## License

hhas has released SwiftAutomation into the public domain. AEthereal uses a dual-licensing approach to retain the spirit of "public domain" while dealing with its often dubious legality.

You may choose one of the following license options:

1. AEthereal is released into the public domain, with absolutely no warranty provided.
2. AEthereal is released under the terms of the MIT License, a copy of which is provided in LICENSE.txt.
